This is a pile of source code for working with Android and Arduino. Mostly
these are Arduino projects that also talk to an Android phone. Don't expect to
find elaborate mature frameworks here; this is mostly just code that runs. If
you want to learn from it or crib from it, awesome; but it won't be
plug-and-play. This is more scratch space for my personal use than a releasable
project.

Each subdirectory is a sub-project; for instance, my instance of the "Garduino"
garden controller from Make Magazine. Each project subdir has all the code for
that project.

The Arduino code is for an Arduino Duemilanove -- i.e. with the ATMega328p. The
Android code is generally for Android 2.1 and later, since most of it uses
Bluetooth. On the Arduino side, I'm using a SparkFun BlueSMiRF as a serial port
relay.

The Makefiles for the Arduino code are derived originally from the one
included with 0017. I hacked them to make them work with 0018, and to play
nicely with a system installation. If you add the Arduino Launchpad project to
an Ubuntu apt-get list and install it, the Makefiles should work pretty much
as-is.

The code is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0, which is my
favorite and which I encourage everyone to consider for their own projects.

Note that the copyright to this code is held by Google, Inc. (my employer),
not me. This is not an official Android project, nor an official Google
project.
