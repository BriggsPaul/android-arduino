This is a pile of source code for working with Android and Arduino. Mostly
these are Arduino projects that also talk to an Android phone. Don't expect to
find elaborate mature frameworks here; this is mostly just code that runs. If
you want to learn from it or crib from it, awesome; but it won't be
plug-and-play. This is more scratch space for my personal use than a releasable
project.

Each subdirectory is a sub-project; for instance, my instance of the "Garduino"
garden controller from Make Magazine. Each project subdir has all the code for
that project.

The Arduino code is for an Arduino Duemilanove -- i.e. with the ATMega328p. The
Android code is generally for Android 2.1 and later, since most of it uses
Bluetooth. On the Arduino side, I'm using a SparkFun BlueSMiRF as a serial port
relay.

The Makefiles in the Arduino directories are generally h@x0r3d versions of the
ones that ship with Arduino distributions -- h@x0r3d because at least in 0017,
the included Makefile doesn't work. Also, I don't like the way it works, and
will probably be improving it over time. (For instance, it doesn't handle the
automatic copy/inclusion of libraries transparently, as the Arduino IDE does.)

The code is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0, which is my
favorite and which I encourage everyone to consider for their own projects.
