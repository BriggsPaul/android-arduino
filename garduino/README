This is my version of Luke Iseman's "Garduino" garden controller from Make
Magazine issue #18: http://makezine.com/18/garduino/

I did not reuse any of Luke's code; this is an original rewrite. Note that my
particular configuration is also simpler than Luke's, in that I use an Earthbox
self-watering planter, and thus don't use any of Luke's moisture sensor
circuits or code.

The code is a straight-up Arduino loop, and uses the DateTime library to only
operate the grow light during daytime. The main loop pumps a state machine and
a command (input) parser over the serial port. This allows it to read commands
from a host either over USB or Bluetooth. Note that if you use a BlueSMiRF or
other TTL device hooked up to the RX/TX pins on the Arduino, it blocks the USB
port from being used to program the device.

Currently I grow basil. Skip the 420 jokes, I've heard them all by now.
